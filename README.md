# Hands-on-UI-UX-Experiments
## AIM:

To understand the fundamentals of UI and UX design, differentiate between them using real-world examples, illustrate their relationship in design, and explore popular UI/UX design tools.

## THEORY:

a. Fundamentals of UI and UX
UI (User Interface): Visual elements like buttons, layout, colors, typography.
UX (User Experience): Overall interaction experience — ease of use, navigation, and satisfaction.

b. Difference between UI and UX (Real-World Case Studies):
Feature	UI Example (Spotify)	UX Example (Spotify)
Visual Design	Clean layout, icons, green theme	Easy playlist creation and song flow
Interactivity	Play button, sliders, tabs	Personalized recommendations
Consistency	Uniform font and icons across app	Fast response time, intuitive controls

c. Relationship Between UI and UX:
Good UX needs good UI to succeed.
UI focuses on how things look; UX focuses on how things work.
Example: A visually stunning app (UI) that’s hard to navigate (UX) fails in overall experience.

d. Demonstration of UI/UX Tools:
Tool	Purpose	Features
Figma	UI/UX :Design & Prototyping	Collaborative design, components, prototyping
Adobe XD:	UI Design & Wireframing	Auto-animation, voice prototyping
Canva	:Simple UI mockups	Templates, drag-and-drop interface
Sketch:UI Design (macOS only)	Vector editing, symbols, plugins

## PROCEDURE:

Study UI and UX definitions and concepts.
Visit apps/websites like Netflix, Spotify, Amazon.
Identify UI components (buttons, colors) and UX flows (navigation, task completion).
Document differences and relationships.
Open Figma/Adobe XD and create a simple login page mockup.
Demonstrate key tools like frame, components, prototyping.
Collaborate or share design to simulate real-world UX workflow.

## RESULT:

Successfully explored the fundamentals of UI/UX, differentiated them using real-world case studies, understood their relationship in design, and demonstrated industry tools.
